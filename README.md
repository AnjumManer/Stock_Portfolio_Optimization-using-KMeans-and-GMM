# Stock_Portfolio_Optimization-using-KMeans-and-GMM
Our work focuses on the opportunities and problems in the stock market as they relate to the nexus of data science and finance. Our project focuses on the use of clustering algorithms as a solution to the complex nature of the stock market, which requires sophisticated analytical techniques for informed decision-making.

Our first guide for figuring out how many clusters is best is the Elbow Method. This is an important step that directly affects how well the subsequent clustering analyses work. This technique helps to strike the right balance so that increasing the number of clusters doesn’t noticeably improve the clustering outcomes. After that, we explore the popular K-means clustering algorithm. The aim is to divide stocks into discrete groups according to critical financial parameters, thereby offering a methodical and informative classification.

Assessing the K-means algorithm is crucial in order to determine how well it clusters a variety of stocks. The algorithm’s capacity to produce distinct, internally homogeneous clusters is demonstrated by quantitative metrics like the Davies-Bouldin Index, Silhouette Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Index. Through the use of these metrics, we hope to both confirm the effectiveness of our clustering and offer a numerical foundation for its dependability in directing financial choices.

We further investigate stock combinations within each cluster in addition to the K-means algorithm. The purpose of this study is to provide investors with strategic advice on portfolio diversification. Knowing the relationships and patterns among stocks becomes a crucial tool for making wise investment decisions in a market that is constantly changing.

We use K-fold cross-validation, a method that guarantees the robustness and generalizability of our algorithms, to strengthen the dependability of our clustering models. We validate the models’ performance in a variety of scenarios by testing them on various subsets of the data, offering a thorough assessment of their effectiveness.

We present the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which adds to our arsenal of analytical tools. This probabilistic clustering method provides a nuanced understanding of stock relationships while accommodating intricate data patterns. An examination of the differences between K-means and GMM reveals which algorithm is more adept at capturing the complex structures present in stock data.
Our project’s main goal is to provide insightful information to the rapidly changing field of finance’s data-driven decision-making. Our goal is to equip investors with advanced tools to navigate the complexities of stock investments by bridging the fields of data science and stock market analysis, ultimately leading to more strategic and informed financial decisions.
